# go-strings

A collection of Golang programs for string manipulation challenges categorized by difficulty.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three directories based on difficulty levels:

- **easy**: Contains a simple program for reversing characters in a string.
- **medium**: Implements a string palindrome checker.
- **hard**: Provides a program to check if two strings are anagrams.

Each directory has its own `main.go` file showcasing the implementation for the respective challenge.
